# Multiple-Linear-Regression-with-Dummies

I created a multiple regression model of a sample real estate dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python to understand the causal relationship among Price, Size, and the availability of Sea View at the real estate properties. Here, Sea View is categorical variable, so I transformed it into a Dummy Variable to create my Model.
